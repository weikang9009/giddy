    "Income mobility could be viewed as a reranking pheonomenon where regions switch income positions while it could also be considered to be happening as long as regions move away from the previous income levels. The former is named absolute mobility and the latter relative mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how to estimate income mobility measures from longitudinal income data using methods in **giddy**. Currently, five summary mobility estimators are implemented in **giddy.mobility**. All of them are Markov-based, meaning that they are closely related to the discrete Markov Chains methods introduced in [Markov Based Methods notebook](Markov Based Methods.ipynb). More specifically, each of them is derived from a transition probability matrix $P$. Whether the final estimate is absolute or reletive mobility depends on how the original continuous income data are discretized."

    "$\\pi$ is the inital income distribution. For any transition probability matrix with a quasi-maximal diagonal, all of these mobility measures take values on $[0,1]$. $0$ means immobility and $1$ perfect mobility. If the transition probability matrix takes the form of the identity matrix, every region is stuck in its current state implying complete immobility. On the contrary, when each row of $P$ is identical, current state is irrelevant to the probability of moving away to any class. Thus, the transition matrix with identical rows is considered perfect mobile. The larger the mobility estimate, the more mobile the regional income system is. However, it should be noted that these measures try to reveal mobility pattern from different aspects and are thus not comparable to each other. Actually the mean and variance of these measures are different. "
